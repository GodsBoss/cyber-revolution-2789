			<h1>Manual</h1>
			<p>The year is 2789. A great revolution is taking place. Traditionally, this leads to many people being killed and it may surprise you, but you are one of them. The guards are somewhat loose regarding the order of their executions, as long as they take place. You probably won't escape, but if you try to cheat a bit, at least you can <em>delay the inevitable</em>.</p>

						<td><strong>Events</strong></td>
						<td>They change the order inside the queue. Select an event, its targets (if any), then invoke the event. There are also options to discard events and to pass.</td>
